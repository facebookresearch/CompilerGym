# Contributing

We want to make contributing to CompilerGym as easy and transparent
as possible. The most helpful ways to contribute are:

1. Provide feedback.
* [Report bugs](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/issues).
  In particular, itâ€™s important to report any crash or correctness bug.
  We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your
  description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to
  reproduce the issue.
* Report issues when the documentation is incomplete or unclear, or an
  error message could be improved.
* Make feature requests. Let us know if you have a use case that is
  not well supported, including as much detail as possible.
2. Contribute to the CompilerGym ecosystem.
* Pull requests. Please see below for details. The easiest way to get
  stuck is to grab an [unassigned "Good first issue"
  ticket](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22)!
* Add new features not on the roadmap. Examples could include adding
  support for new compilers, producing research results using
  CompilerGym, etc.


## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork [the repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym) and create
   your branch from `development`.
2. Follow the instructions for
   [building from source](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#building-from-source)
   to set up your environment.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the [documentation](/docs/source).
5. Ensure the `make test` suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints (see "Code Style" below).
7. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement
   ("CLA").


## Code Style

We want to ease the burden of code formatting using tools. Our code style
is simple:

* Python:
  [black](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md)
  and [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/).
* C++: [Google C++
  style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with 100
  character line length and `camelCaseFunctionNames()`.

We use [pre-commit](/.pre-commit-config.yaml) to format our code to
enforce these rules. Before submitting pull requests, please run
pre-commit to ensure the code is correctly formatted.

Other common sense rules we encourage are:

* Prefer descriptive names over short ones.
* Split complex code into small units.
* When writing new features, add tests.
* Prefer easy-to-use code over easy-to-read, and easy-to-read code over
  easy-to-write.


## Leaderboard Submissions
