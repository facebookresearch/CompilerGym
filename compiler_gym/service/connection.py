class CompilerGymServiceConnection:
    """A connection to a compiler gym service.

    There are two types of service connections: managed and unmanaged. The type
    of connection is determined by the endpoint. If a "host:port" URL is provided,
    an unmanaged connection is created. If the path of a file is provided, a
    managed connection is used. The difference between a managed and unmanaged
    connection is that with a managed connection, the lifecycle of the service
    if controlled by the client connection. That is, when a managed connection
    is created, a service subprocess is started by executing the specified path.
    When the connection is closed, the subprocess is terminated. With an
    unmanaged connection, if the service fails is goes offline, the client will
    fail.

    This class provides a common abstraction between the two types of connection,
    and provides a call method for invoking remote procedures on the service.

    Example usage of an unmanaged service connection:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Connect to a service running on localhost:8080. The user must
        # started a process running on port 8080.
        connection = CompilerGymServiceConnection("localhost:8080")
        # Invoke an RPC method.
        connection(connection.stub.StartSession, StartSessionRequest())
        # Close the connection. The service running on port 8080 is
        # left running.
        connection.close()

    Example usage of a managed service connection:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Start a subprocess using the binary located at /path/to/my/service.
        connection = CompilerGymServiceConnection(Path("/path/to/my/service"))
        # Invoke an RPC method.
        connection(connection.stub.StartSession, StartSessionRequest())
        # Close the connection. The subprocess is terminated.
        connection.close()

    :ivar stub: A CompilerGymServiceStub that can be used as the first argument
        to :py:meth:`__call__()` to specify an RPC
