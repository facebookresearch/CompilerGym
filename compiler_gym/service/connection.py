    There are two types of service connections: managed and unmanaged. The type
    of connection is determined by the endpoint. If a "host:port" URL is
    provided, an unmanaged connection is created. If the path of a file is
    provided, a managed connection is used. The difference between a managed and
    unmanaged connection is that with a managed connection, the lifecycle of the
    service if controlled by the client connection. That is, when a managed
    connection is created, a service subprocess is started by executing the
    specified path. When the connection is closed, the subprocess is terminated.
    With an unmanaged connection, if the service fails is goes offline, the
    client will fail.

    This class provides a common abstraction between the two types of
    connection, and provides a call method for invoking remote procedures on the
    service.

    Example usage of an unmanaged service connection:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Connect to a service running on localhost:8080. The user must
        # started a process running on port 8080.
        connection = CompilerGymServiceConnection("localhost:8080")
        # Invoke an RPC method.
        connection(connection.stub.StartSession, StartSessionRequest())
        # Close the connection. The service running on port 8080 is
        # left running.
        connection.close()

    Example usage of a managed service connection:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Start a subprocess using the binary located at /path/to/my/service.
        connection = CompilerGymServiceConnection(Path("/path/to/my/service"))
        # Invoke an RPC method.
        connection(connection.stub.StartSession, StartSessionRequest())
        # Close the connection. The subprocess is terminated.
        connection.close()
