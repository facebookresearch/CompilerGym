"""Run a CompilerGym environment with text interface controls.

.. code-block::

    $ python -m compiler_gym.bin.manual_env --env=<env> [--benchmark=<name>] [--observation=<space>] [--reward=<space>]

The benchmark to use can be specified using :code:`--benchmark=<name>`.

**************************
CompilerGym Shell Tutorial
**************************

This program gives a basic shell through which many of commands from
CompilerGym can be executed. CompilerGym provides a simple Python interface to
various compiler functions, enabling programs to be compiled in different ways
and to make queries about those programs. The goal is to have a simple system
for machine learning in compilers.

Downloading a Dataset
---------------------
When entering the Shell, the environment (compiler choice) will have already
been made on the command line. The benchmark or program to be compiled may not
yet be set. Before setting a benchmark, however, the corresponding dataset must
be downloaded. You may have already downloaded a dataset through the
compiler_gym.bin.datasets command, but if not, you can do that from this shell.

To download a dataset, call:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:NO-BENCHMARK> require_dataset <dataset-name>

The command and the dataset name should tab-complete for you (most things will
tab-complete in the shell). You can also see what datasets are available with
this command:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:NO-BENCHMARK> list_datasets

Setting a Benchmark, Reward and Observation
-------------------------------------------
The CompilerGym operates on a program or benchmark. If not set on the command
line, the benchmark can be specified in the shell with:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:NO-BENCHMARK> set_benchmark <benchmark-name>

When a benchmark is set, the prompt will update with the name of the benchmark.
Supposing that is "bench", then the prompt would be:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench>

The list of available benchmarks can be shown with:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> list_benchmarks

The default reward and observation can be similarly set with:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> set_default_reward <reward-name>
    compilergym:bench> set_default_observation <observation-name>

And lists of the choices are available with:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> list_rewards
    compilergym:bench> list_observations

The default rewards and observations will be reported every time an action is
taken. So, if, for example, you want to see how the instruction count of the
benchmark program is affected by your actions, set the default reward to
"IrInstructionCount". Then the change in instruction count for each action will
be reported.

Additionally, some of the search techniques require the default reward to be
set, since they will try to optimise that reward.

Actions and the Action Stack
----------------------------
In CompilerGym an action corresponds to invoking an compiler operation
(currently an LLVM opt pass) on the intermediate representation of the program.
Each action acts on the result of the previous action and so on.

So, for example, to apply first the 'tail call elimination' pass, then the
'loop unrolling' pass we call two actions:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> action -tailcallelim
    compilergym:bench> action -loop-unroll

Each action will report its default reward.
Note that multiple actions can be placed on a single line, so that the above is
equivalent to:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> action -tailcallelim -loop-unroll

You can choose a random action, by using just a '-' as the action name:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> action -

Since an empty line on the shell repeats the last action, you can execute many
random actions by typing that line first then holding down return.

The actions are recorded in a stack, with the latest action on the top of the
stack. You can view the action stack with stack command:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> stack

This will show for each action if it had an effect (as computed by the
underlying compiler), whether this terminated compiler, and what the per action
and cumulative rewards are.

The last action can be undone by:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> undo

All actions in the stack can be undone at once by:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> reset

You can find out what the effect of each action would be by calling this
command:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> try_all_actions

This will show a table with the reward for each action, sorted by best first.

If you have a large stack of actions, many of which are not profitable, you can
simplify the stack with this command:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> simplify_stack

This will redo the entire stack, keeping only those actions which previously
gave good rewards. (Note this doesn't mean that the simplified stack will only
have positive rewards, some negative actions may be necessary set up for a
later positive reward.)

Current Status
--------------
For the current state of the program - after whatever actions have been called
on it - you can make several queries.

The first is to get a reward. This might not be the same as the current default
reward:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> reward <reward-name>

You can see various observations with:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> observation <observation-name>

Finally, you can print the equivalent command line for achieving the same
behaviour as the actions through the standard system shell:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> commandline

Searching
---------
Some very basic search capabilities are supported, directly in the shell. Each
of them just looks for another action to add.

First, is the random search through this command:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> action -

Multiple steps can be taken by holding down the return key.

A hill-climbing search tries an action, but will only accept it if it yields a
positive reward:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> hill_climb <num-steps>

A simple greedy search tries all possible actions and takes the one with the
highest reward, stopping when no action has a positive reward:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> greedy <num-steps>

Miscellaneous
-------------
One useful command is:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> breakpoint

Which drops into the python debugger. This is very useful if you want to see
what is going on internally. There is a 'self.env' object that represents the
environment that is definitely worth exploring.

And finally:

.. code-block::

    compilergym:bench> exit

Drops out of the shell. :code:`Ctrl-D` should have the same effect.
