# Common flag definitions for command line usage

This directory contains modules that define command line flags for use by
`compiler_gym.bin` and other scripts. The reason for defining flags here is to
allow flag names to be reused across scripts without causing multiple-definition
errors when the scripts are imported.

Using these flags requires that the absl flags library is initialized. As such
they should not be used in the core library.
