"""This module defines utilities for minimizing trajectories.

A trajectory is the sequence of actions applied to an environment. The goal of
trajectory minimization is to identify the shortest subregion of a trajectory
such that some hypothesis still holds. A a hypothesis is a boolean test on an
environment, for example, a hypothesis could be that :code:`env.validate()`
returns an error.
