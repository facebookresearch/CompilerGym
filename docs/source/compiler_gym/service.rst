compiler_gym.service
====================

.. currentmodule:: compiler_gym.service

CompilerGym uses a client/server architecture. Services provide an
interface for manipulating compiler behavior. Clients are Python
frontend objects that provide a reinforcement learning abstraction on
top of the service. Communication between the service and client is
done using RPC. The connection between the client and service is
managed by the :class:`CompilerGymServiceConnection` object.

The connection object
---------------------

.. autoclass:: CompilerGymServiceConnection
   :members:

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: __call__

Configuring the connection
--------------------------

The :class:`ConnectionOpts` object is used to configure the options
used for managing a service connection.

Exceptions
----------

In general, errors raised by the service are converted to the
equivalent builtin exception type, e.g., `ValueError` for invalid
method arguments, and `FileNotFound` for resource errors. However,
some error cases are not well covered by the builtin exception
hierarchy. For those cases, we define custom exception types, all
inheriting from a base :class:`ServiceError` class:

.. autoexception:: ServiceError

.. autoexception:: ServiceInitError

.. autoexception:: ServiceTransportError

.. autoexception:: ServiceIsClosed

.. autoexception:: SessionNotFound
