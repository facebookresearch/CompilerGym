    "CompilerGym is a toolkit for applying reinforcement learning to compiler optimization tasks. This document provides a short walkthrough of the key concepts, using the codesize reduction task of a production-grade compiler as an example. It will take about 20 minutes to work through. Lets get started!"

    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "CompilerGym exposes compiler optimization problems as environments for reinforcement learning. It uses the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) interface to expose the “agent-environment loop” of reinforcement learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "![overview](https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/_images/overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ingredients for reinforcement learning that CompilerGym provides are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Environment**: a compiler optimization task. For example, *optimizing a C++ graph-traversal program for codesize using LLVM*. The environment encapsulates an instance of a compiler and a particular program that is being compiled. As an agent interacts with the environment, the state of the program, and the compiler, can change.\n",
    "* **Action Space**: the actions that may be taken at the current environment state. For example, this could be a set of optimization transformations that the compiler can apply to the program.\n",
    "* **Observation**: a view of the current environment state. For example, this could be the Intermediate Representation (IR) of the program that is being compiled. The types of observations that are available depend on the compiler.\n",
    "* **Reward**: a metric indicating the quality of the previous action. For example, for a codesize optimization task this could be the change to the number of instructions of the previous action.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single instance of this “agent-environment loop” represents the compilation of a particular program. The goal is to develop an agent that maximises the cumulative reward from these environments so as to produce the best programs."

    "## Selecting an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "CompilerGym environments are named using one of the following formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `<compiler>-<observation>-<reward>-<version>`\n",
    "* `<compiler>-<reward>-<version>`\n",
    "* `<compiler>-<version>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `<compiler>` identifiers the compiler optimization task, `<observation>` is the default type of observations that are provided, and `<reward>` is the reward signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** A key concept is that CompilerGym environments enables **lazy evaluation** of observations and reward signals. This makes the environment much more computationally efficient for scenarios in which you do not need to compute a reward or observation for every step. If an environment omits a `<observation>` or `<reward>` tag, this means that no observation or reward is provided by default. See [compiler_gym.views](https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/views.html) for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the following environment:\n",
    "* **Compiler**: [LLVM](https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html)\n",
    "* **Observation Type**: [Autophase](https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#autophase)\n",
    "* **Reward Signal**: [IR Instruction count relative to -Oz](https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#codesize)\n",
