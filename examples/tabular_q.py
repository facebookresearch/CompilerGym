    For tabular learning we will be constructing a Q-table which maps a
    (state, action) pair to an expected (remaining) reward. The purpose of this
    function is to convert the (state, action) properties into a hashable tuple
    that can be used as a key for a Q-table dictionary.

    In the CompilerGym setup, encoding the true state the program is not obvious,
    and this solution turns to use the observations from Autophase features instead.
    The default arguments handpicked 3 indices from the Autophase feature that
    appear to change a lot during optimization.

    In addition, the current step in the episode is added to the state representation
    as well. In the current fixed-episode-length setup, we need to differentiate
    reaching a state at different steps, as they can lead to different final rewards,
    depending on the remaining optimization steps.

    Finally, we add the action index to the key.
