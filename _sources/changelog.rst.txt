Release 0.2.4 (2022-05-24)
--------------------------

This release adds a new compiler environment, new APIs, and a suite of
backend improvements to improve the flexibility of CompilerGym
environments. Many thanks to code contributors: @sogartar, @KyleHerndon,
@SoumyajitKarmakar, @uduse, and @anthony0727!

Highlights of this release include:

-  [mlir] Began work on a new environment for matrix multiplication
   using MLIR
   (`#652 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/652>`__,
   thanks @KyleHerndon and @sogartar!). Note this environment is not yet
   included in the pypi package and must be `compiled from
   source <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/INSTALL.md#building-from-source-with-cmake>`__.
-  [llvm] Added a new ``env.benchmark_from_clang_invocation()`` method
   (`#577 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/577>`__)
   that can be used for constructing LLVM environment automatically from
   C/C++ compiler invocations. This makes it much easier to integrate
   CompilerGym with your existing build scripts.
-  Added three new wrapper classes: ``Counter``, that provides op counts
   for analysis
   (`#683 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/683>`__);
   ``SynchronousSqliteLogger``, that provides logging of environment
   interactions to a relational database
   (`#679 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/679>`__),
   and ``ForkOnStep`` that provides an ``undo()`` operation
   (`#682 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/682>`__).
-  Added ``reward_space`` and ``observation_space`` parameters to
   ``env.reset()``
   (`#659 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/659>`__,
   thanks @SoumyajitKarmakar!)

This release includes a number of improvements to the backend APIs that
make it easier to write new CompilerGym environments:

-  Refactored the backend to make ``CompilerEnv`` an abstract interface,
   and ``ClientServiceCompilerEnv`` the concrete implementation of this
   interface. This enables new environments to be implemented without
   using gRPC
   (`#633 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/633>`__,
   thanks @sogartar!).
-  Extended the support for different types of action and observation
   spaces
   (`#641 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/641>`__,
   `#643 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/643>`__,
   thanks @sogartar!), including new ``Permutation`` and
   ``SpaceSequence`` spaces
   (`#645 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/645>`__,
   thanks @sogartar!)..
-  Added a new ``disk/`` subdirectory to compiler service’s working
   directories, which is symlinked to an on-disk location for devices
   which support in-memory working directories. This fixes a bug with
   leftover temporary directories from LLVM
   (`#672 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/672>`__).

This release also includes numerous bug fixes and improvements, many of
which were reported or fixed by the community. For example, fixing a bug
in cache file locations
(`#656 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/656>`__,
thanks @uduse!), and a missing flag definition in example code
(`#684 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/684>`__,
thanks @anthony0727!).

Release 0.2.3 (2022-03-18)
--------------------------

This release brings in deprecating changes to the core ``env.step()``
routine, and lays the groundwork for enabling new types of compiler
optimizations to be exposed through CompilerGym. Many thanks to code
contributors: @mostafaelhoushi, @sogartar, @KyleHerndon, @uduse,
@parthchadha, and @xtremey!

Highlights of this release include:

-  Added a new ``TextSizeInBytes`` observation space for LLVM
   (`#575 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/575>`__).
-  Added a new PPO leaderboard entry
   (`#580 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/580>`__.
   Thanks @xtremey!
-  Fixed a bug in which temporary directories created by the LLVM
   environment were not cleaned up
   (`#592 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/592>`__).
-  **[Backend]** The function ``createAndRunCompilerGymService`` now
   returns an int, which is the exit return code
   (`#592 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/592>`__).
-  Improvements to the examples documentation
   (`#548 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/548>`__)
   and FAQ
   (`#586 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/586>`__)

Deprecations and breaking changes:

-  ``CompilerEnv.step`` no longer accepts a list of actions
   (`#627 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/627>`__).
   A new method, ``CompilerEnv.multistep`` provides this functionality.
   This is to provide compatibility with environments whose action
   spaces are lists. To update your code, replace any calls to
   ``env.step()`` which take a list of actions to use
   ``env.multistep()``. Thanks @sogartar!
-  The arguments ``observations`` and ``rewards`` to ``step()`` have
   been renamed ``observation_spaces`` and ``reward_spaces``,
   respectively
   (`#627 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/627>`__).
-  ``Reward.id`` has been renamed ``Reward.name``
   (`#565 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/565>`__,
   `#612 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/612>`__).
   Thanks @parthchadha!
-  The backend protocol buffer schema has been updated to natively
   support more types of observation and action, and to support nested
   spaces
   (`#531 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/531>`__).
   Thanks @sogartar!

   API <https://compilergym.com/compiler_gym/datasets.html#datasets>`__.
   The following has been removed:

   -  The ``compiler_gym.bin.datasets`` script.
   -  The properties: ``CompilerEnv.available_datasets``, and
      ``CompilerEnv.benchmarks``.
   -  The ``CompilerEnv.require_dataset()``,
      ``CompilerEnv.require_datasets()``,
      ``CompilerEnv.register_dataset()``, and
      ``CompilerEnv.get_benchmark_validation_callback()`` methods.

-  Numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.2.1 (2021-11-17)
--------------------------

Highlights of this release include:

-  **[Complex and composite action spaces]** Added a new schema for
   describing action spaces
   (`#369 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/369>`__).
   This complete overhaul enables a much richer set of actions to be
   exposed, such as composite actions spaces, dictionaries, and
   continuous actions.
-  **[State Transition Dataset]** We have released the first iteration
   of the state transition dataset, a large collection of
   (state,action,reward) tuples for the LLVM environments, suitable for
   large-scale supervised learning. We have added an example learned
   cost model using a graph neural network in
   ``examples/gnn_cost_model``
   (`#484 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/484>`__,
   thanks @bcui19!).
-  **[New examples]** We have added several new examples to the
   ``examples/`` directory, including a new loop unrolling demo based on
   LLVM
   (`#477 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/477>`__,
   thanks @mostafaelhoushi!), a loop tool demo
   (`#457 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/457>`__,
   thanks @bwasti!), micro-benchmarks for operations, and example
   reinforcement learning scripts
   (`#484 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/484>`__).
   See ``examples/README.md`` for details. We also overhauled the
   example compiler gym service
   (`#467 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/467>`__).
-  **[New logo]** Thanks Christy for designing a great new logo for
   CompilerGym!
   (`#471 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/471>`__)
-  **[llvm]** Added a new ``Bitcode`` observation space
   (`#442 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/442>`__).
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Deprecations and breaking changes:

-  **[Backend API change]** Out-of-tree compiler services will require
   updating to the new action space API
   (`#369 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/369>`__).
-  The ``env.observation.add_derived_space()`` method has been
   deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the
   new ``derived_observation_spaces`` argument to the ``CompilerEnv``
   constructor
   (`#463 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/463>`__).
-  The ``compiler_gym.utils.logs`` module has been deprecated. Use
   ``compiler_gym.utils.runfiles_path`` instead
   (`#453 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/453>`__).
-  The ``compiler_gym.replay_search`` module has been deprecated and
   merged into the ``compiler_gym.random_search``
   (`#453 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/453>`__).

Release 0.2.0 (2021-09-28)
--------------------------

This release adds two new compiler optimization problems to CompilerGym:
GCC command line flag optimization and CUDA loop nest optimization.

-  **[GCC]** A new ``gcc-v0`` environment, authored by @hughleat,
   exposes the command line flags of `GCC <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`__ as a
   reinforcement learning environment. GCC is a production-grade
   compiler for C and C++ used throughout industry. The environment
   provides several datasets and a large, high dimensional action space
   that works on several GCC versions. For further details check out the
   `reference
   documentation <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/envs/gcc.html>`__.
-  **[loop_tool]** A new ``loop_tool-v0`` environment, authored by
   @bwasti, provides an experimental intermediate representation of
   *n*-dimensional data computation that can be lowered to both CPU and
   GPU backends. This provides a reinforcement learning environment for
   manipulating nests of loop computations to maximize throughput. For
   further details check out the `reference
   documentation <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/envs/loop_tool.html>`__.

Other highlights of this release include:

-  **[Docker]** Published a
   `chriscummins/compiler_gym <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chriscummins/compiler_gym>`__
   docker image that can be used to run CompilerGym services in
   standalone isolated containers
   (`#424 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/424>`__).
-  **[LLVM]** Fixed a bug in the experimental ``Runtime`` observation
   space that caused observations to slow down over time
   (`#398 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/398>`__).
-  **[LLVM]** Added a new utility module to compute observations from
   bitcodes
   (`#405 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/405>`__).
-  Overhauled the continuous integration services to reduce
   computational requirements by 59.4% while increasing test coverage
   (`#392 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/392>`__).
-  Improved error reporting if computing an observation fails
   (`#380 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/380>`__).
-  Changed the return type of ``compiler_gym.random_search()`` to a
   ``CompilerEnv``
   (`#387 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/387>`__).
-  Numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

Many thanks to code contributors: @thecoblack, @bwasti, @hughleat, and
@sahirgomez1!

Release 0.1.10 (2021-09-08)
---------------------------

This release lays the foundation for several new exciting additions to
CompilerGym:

-  [LLVM] Added experimental support for **optimizing for runtime** and
   **compile time**
   (`#307 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/307>`__).
   This is still proof of concept and is not yet stable. For now, only
   the ``benchmark://cbench-v1`` and ``generator://csmith-v0`` datasets
   are supported.
-  [CompilerGym Explorer] Started development of a **web frontend** for
   the LLVM environments. The work-in-progress Flask API and React
   website can be found in the ``www`` directory.
-  [New Backend API] Added a mechanism for sending arbitrary data
   payloads to the compiler service backends
   (`#313 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/313>`__).
   This allows ad-hoc parameters that do not conform to the usual action
   space to be set for the duration of an episode. Add support for these
   parameters in the backend by implementing the optional
   `handle_session_parameter() <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/63ee95a34157856ca21c392c49d35234e065fa8d/compiler_gym/service/compilation_session.py#L94-L112>`__
   method, and then send parameters using the
   `send_params() <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/63ee95a34157856ca21c392c49d35234e065fa8d/compiler_gym/envs/compiler_env.py#L1317-L1338>`__
   method.

Other highlights of this release include:

-  [LLVM] The Csmith program generator is now shipped as part of the
   CompilerGym binary release, removing the need to compile it locally
   (`#348 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/348>`__).
-  [LLVM] A new ``ProgramlJson`` observation space provides the JSON
   node-link data of a ProGraML graph without parsing to a
   ``nx.MultiDiGraph``
   (`#332 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/332>`__).
-  [LLVM] Added a leaderboard submission for a DQN agent
   (`#292 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/292>`__,
   thanks @phesse001!).
-  [Backend API Update] The ``Reward.reset()`` method now receives an
   observation view that can be used to compute initial states
   (`#341 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/341>`__,
   thanks @bwasti!).
-  [Datasets API] The size of infinite datasets has been changed from
   ``float("inf")`` to ``0``
   (`#347 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/347>`__).
   This is a compatibility fix for ``__len__()`` which requires integers
   values.
-  Prevent excessive growth of in-memory caches
   (`#299 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/299>`__).
-  Multiple compatibility fixes for ``compiler_gym.wrappers``.
-  Numerous other bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.9 (2021-06-03)
--------------------------

This release of CompilerGym focuses on **backend extensibility** and
adds a bunch of new features to make it easier to add support for new
compilers:

-  Adds a new ``CompilationSession`` class encapsulates a single
   incremental compilation session
   (`#261 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/261>`__).
-  Adds a common runtime for CompilerGym services that takes a
   ``CompilationSession`` subclass and handles all the RPC wrangling for
   you
   (`#270 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/270>`__).
-  Ports the LLVM service and example services to the new runtime
   (`#277 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/277>`__).
   This provides a net performance win with fewer lines of code.

Other highlights of this release include:

-  [Core API] Adds a new ``compiler_gym.wrappers`` module that makes it
   easy to apply modular transformations to CompilerGym environments
   without modifying the environment code
   (`#272 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/272>`__).
-  [Core API] Adds a new ``Datasets.random_benchmark()`` method for
   selecting a uniform random benchmark from one or more datasets
   (`#247 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/247>`__).
-  [Core API] Adds a new ``compiler_gym.make()`` function, equivalent to
   ``gym.make()``
   (`#257 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/257>`__).
-  [LLVM] Adds a new ``IrSha1`` observation space that uses a fast,
   service-side C++ implementation to compute a checksum of the
   environment state
   (`#267 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/267>`__).
-  [LLVM] Adds 12 new C programs from the CHStone benchmark suite
   (`#284 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/284>`__).
-  [LLVM] Adds the ``anghabench-v1`` dataset and deprecated
   ``anghabench-v0``
   (`#242 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/242>`__).
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.8 (2021-04-30)
--------------------------

This release introduces some significant changes to the way that
benchmarks are managed, introducing a new dataset API. This enabled us
to add support for millions of new benchmarks and a more efficient
implementation for the LLVM environment, but this will require some
migrating of old code to the new interfaces (see “Migration Checklist”
below). Some of the key changes of this release are:

-  **[Core API change]** We have added a Python
   `Benchmark <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/datasets.html#compiler_gym.datasets.Benchmark>`__
   class
   (`#190 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/190>`__).
   The ``env.benchmark`` attribute is now an instance of this class
   rather than a string
   (`#222 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/222>`__).
-  **[Core behavior change]** Environments will no longer select
   benchmarks randomly. Now ``env.reset()`` will now always select the
   last-used benchmark, unless the ``benchmark`` argument is provided or
   ``env.benchmark`` has been set. If no benchmark is specified, a
   default is used.
-  **[API deprecations]** We have added a new
   `Dataset <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/datasets.html#compiler_gym.datasets.Dataset>`__
   class hierarchy
   (`#191 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/191>`__,
   `#192 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/192>`__).
   All datasets are now available without needing to be downloaded
   first, and a new
   `Datasets <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/compiler_gym/datasets.html#compiler_gym.datasets.Datasets>`__
   class can be used to iterate over them
   (`#200 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/200>`__).
   We have deprecated the old dataset management operations, the
   ``compiler_gym.bin.datasets`` script, and removed the ``--dataset``
   and ``--ls_benchmark`` flags from the command line tools.
-  **[RPC interface change]** The ``StartSession`` RPC endpoint now
   accepts a list of initial observations to compute. This removes the
   need for an immediate call to ``Step``, reducing environment reset
   time by 15-21%
   (`#189 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/189>`__).
-  [LLVM] We have added several new datasets of benchmarks, including
   the Csmith and llvm-stress program generators
   (`#207 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/207>`__),
   a dataset of OpenCL kernels
   (`#208 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/208>`__),
   and a dataset of compilable C functions
   (`#210 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/210>`__).
   See `the
   docs <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/llvm/index.html#datasets>`__
   for an overview.
-  ``CompilerEnv`` now takes an optional ``Logger`` instance at
   construction time for fine-grained control over logging output
   (`#187 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/187>`__).
-  [LLVM] The ModuleID and source_filename of LLVM-IR modules are now
   anonymized to prevent unintentional overfitting to benchmarks by name
   (`#171 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/171>`__).
-  [docs] We have added a `Feature
   Stability <https://facebookresearch.github.io/CompilerGym/about.html#feature-stability>`__
   section to the documentation
   (`#196 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/196>`__).
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Please use this checklist when updating code for the previous
CompilerGym release:

-  Review code that accesses the ``env.benchmark`` property and update
   to ``env.benchmark.uri`` if a string name is required. Setting this
   attribute by string (``env.benchmark = "benchmark://a-v0/b"``) and
   comparison to string types
   (``env.benchmark == "benchmark://a-v0/b"``) still work.
-  Review code that calls ``env.reset()`` without first setting a
   benchmark. Previously, calling ``env.reset()`` would select a random
   benchmark. Now, ``env.reset()`` always selects the last used
   benchmark, or a predetermined default if none is specified.
-  Review code that relies on ``env.benchmark`` being ``None`` to select
   benchmarks randomly. Now, ``env.benchmark`` is always set to the
   previously used benchmark, or a predetermined default benchmark if
   none has been specified. Setting ``env.benchmark = None`` will raise
   an error. Select a benchmark randomly by sampling from the
   ``env.datasets.benchmark_uris()`` iterator.
-  Remove calls to ``env.require_dataset()`` and related operations.
   These are no longer required.
-  Remove accesses to ``env.benchmarks``. An iterator over available
   benchmark URIs is now available at ``env.datasets.benchmark_uris()``,
   but the list of URIs cannot be relied on to be fully enumerable (the
   LLVM environments have over 2^32 URIs).
-  Review code that accesses ``env.observation_space`` and update to
   ``env.observation_space_spec`` where necessary
   (`#228 <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/228>`__).
-  Update compiler service implementations to support the updated RPC
   interface by removing the deprecated ``GetBenchmarks`` RPC endpoint
   and replacing it with ``Dataset`` classes. See the `example
   service <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/tree/development/examples/example_compiler_gym_service>`__
   for details.
-  [LLVM] Update references to the ``poj104-v0`` dataset to
   ``poj104-v1``.
-  [LLVM] Update references to the ``cBench-v1`` dataset to
   ``cbench-v1``.

Release 0.1.7 (2021-04-01)
--------------------------

This release introduces `public
leaderboards <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards>`__
to track the performance of user-submitted algorithms on compiler
optimization tasks.

-  Added a new ``compiler_gym.leaderboard`` package which contains
   utilities for preparing leaderboard submissions
   `(#161) <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/161>`__.
-  Added a LLVM instruction count leaderboard and seeded it with a
   random search baseline
   `(#117) <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/117>`__.
-  Added support for Python 3.9, extending the set of supported python
   versions to 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9
   `(#160) <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/160>`__.
-  [llvm] Added a new ``InstCount`` observation space that contains the
   counts of each type of instruction
   `(#159) <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/159>`__.

**Build dependencies update notice:** If you are building from source
and upgrading from an older version of CompilerGym, your build
environment will need to be updated. The easiest way to do that is to
remove your existing conda environment using
``conda remove --name compiler_gym --all`` and to repeat the steps in
`building from
source <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#building-from-source>`__.

Release 0.1.6 (2021-03-22)
--------------------------

This release focuses on hardening the LLVM environments, providing
improved semantics validation, and improving the datasets. Many thanks
to @JD-at-work, @bwasti, and @mostafaelhoushi for code contributions.

-  [llvm] Added a new ``cBench-v1`` dataset which changes the function
   attributes of the IR to permit inlining. ``cBench-v0`` is deprecated
   and will be removed no earlier than v0.1.6.
-  [llvm] Removed 15 passes from the LLVM action space:
   ``-bounds-checking``, ``-chr``, ``-extract-blocks``, ``-gvn-sink``,
   ``-loop-extract-single``, ``-loop-extract``, ``-objc-arc-apelim``,
   ``-objc-arc-contract``, ``-objc-arc-expand``, ``-objc-arc``,
   ``-place-safepoints``, ``-rewrite-symbols``,
   ``-strip-dead-debug-info``, ``-strip-nonlinetable-debuginfo``,
   ``-structurizecfg``. Passes are removed if they are: irrelevant
   (e.g. used only debugging), if they change the program semantics
   (e.g. inserting runtimes bound checking), or if they have been found
   to have nondeterministic behavior between runs.
-  Extended ``env.step()`` so that it can take a list of actions that
   are all performed in a single batch. This improve efficiency.
-  Added default reward spaces for ``CompilerEnv`` that are derived from
   scalar observations (thanks @bwasti!)
-  Added a new Q learning example (thanks @JD-at-work!).
-  *Deprecation:* The v0.1.8 release will introduce a new datasets API
   that is easier to use and more flexible. In preparation for this, the
   ``Dataset`` class has been renamed to ``LegacyDataset``, the
   following dataset operations have been marked deprecated:
   ``activate()``, ``deactivate()``, and ``delete()``. The
   ``GetBenchmarks()`` RPC interface method has also been marked
   deprecated.
-  [llvm] Improved semantics validation using LLVM’s memory, thread,
   address, and undefined behavior sanitizers.
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.3 (2021-02-25)
--------------------------

This release adds numerous enhancements aimed at improving ease-of-use.
Thanks to @broune, @hughleat, and @JD-ETH for contributions.

-  Added a new ``env.validate()`` API for validating the state of an
   environment. Added semantics validation for some LLVM benchmarks.
-  Added a ``env.fork()`` method to efficiently duplicate an environment
   state.
-  The ``manual_env`` environment has been improved with new features
   such as hill climbing search and tab completion.
-  Ease of use improvements for string observation space and reward
   space names: Added new getter methods such as
   ``env.observation.Autophase()`` and generated constants such as
   ``llvm.observation_spaces.autophase``.
-  *Breaking change*: Calculation of environment reward has been moved
   to Python. Reward functions have been removed from backend service
   implementations and replaced with equivalent Python classes.
-  Various bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.2 (2021-01-25)
--------------------------

-  Add a new
   ``compiler_gym.views.ObservationView.add_derived_space(...)`` API for
   constructing derived observation spaces.
-  Added default reward and observation values for ``env.step()`` in
   case of service failure.
-  Extended the public ``compiler_gym.datasets`` API for managing
   datasets.
-  [llvm] Adds ``-Norm``-suffixed rewards that are normalized to
   unoptimized cost.
-  Extended documentation and example codes.
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.1 (2020-12-28)
--------------------------

-  Expose the package version through ``compiler_gym.__version__``, and
   the compiler version through ``CompilerEnv.compiler_version``.
-  Add a `notebook
   version <https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/examples/getting-started.ipynb>`__
   of the “Getting Started” guide that can be run in colab.
-  [llvm] Reformulate reward signals to be cumulative.
-  [llvm] Add a new reward signal based on the size of the ``.text``
   section of compiled object files.
-  [llvm] Add a ``LlvmEnv.make_benchmark()`` API for easily constructing
   custom benchmarks for use in environments.
-  Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

Release 0.1.0 (2020-12-21)
--------------------------

Initial release.
