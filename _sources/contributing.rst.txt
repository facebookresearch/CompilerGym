Contributing
============

We want to make contributing to CompilerGym as easy and transparent as
possible. The most helpful ways to contribute are:

1. Provide feedback.

   -  `Report
      bugs <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/issues>`__.
      In particular, it’s important to report any crash or correctness
      bug. We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your
      description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to
      reproduce the issue.
   -  Report issues when the documentation is incomplete or unclear, or
      an error message could be improved.
   -  Make feature requests. Let us know if you have a use case that is
      not well supported, including as much detail as possible.

2. Contribute to the CompilerGym ecosystem.

   -  Pull requests. Please see below for details. The easiest way to
      get stuck is to grab an `unassigned “Good first issue”
      ticket <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22>`__!
   -  Add new features not on the roadmap. Examples could include adding
      support for new compilers, producing research results using
      CompilerGym, etc.

Pull Requests
-------------

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork `the repo <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym>`__
   and create your branch from ``development``.
2. Follow the instructions for `building from
   source <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#building-from-source>`__
   to set up your environment.
3. If you’ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you’ve changed APIs, update the `documentation </docs/source>`__.
5. Ensure the ``make test`` suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints (see “Code Style” below).
7. If you haven’t already, complete the Contributor License Agreement
   (“CLA”).

Code Style
----------

We want to ease the burden of code formatting using tools. Our code
style is simple:

-  Python:
   `black <https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md>`__
   and `isort <https://pypi.org/project/isort/>`__.
-  C++: `Google C++
   style <https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html>`__ with 100
   character line length and ``camelCaseFunctionNames()``.

We use `pre-commit </.pre-commit-config.yaml>`__ to format our code to
enforce these rules. Before submitting pull requests, please run
pre-commit to ensure the code is correctly formatted.

Other common sense rules we encourage are:

-  Prefer descriptive names over short ones.
-  Split complex code into small units.
-  When writing new features, add tests.
-  Prefer easy-to-use code over easy-to-read, and easy-to-read code over
   easy-to-write.

Leaderboard Submissions
-----------------------

To add a new result to the leaderboard, add a new entry to the
leaderboard table and file a `Pull Request <#pull-requests>`__. Please
include:

1. A list of all authors.
2. A CSV file of your results.
3. A write-up of your approach. You may use the `submission
   template </leaderboard/SUBMISSION_TEMPLATE.md>`__ as a guide.

Please `take a look
here <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/127>`__ for
an example of a well-formed pull request submission.

Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)
-------------------------------------

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once to work on any of Facebook’s open source
projects.
