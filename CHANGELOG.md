## Release 0.1.7 (2021-04-01)

This release introduces [public
leaderboards](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#leaderboards) to
track the performance of user-submitted algorithms on compiler optimization
tasks.

- Added a new `compiler_gym.leaderboard` package which contains utilities for
  preparing leaderboard submissions
  [(#161)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/161).
- Added a LLVM instruction count leaderboard and seeded it with a random search
  baseline [(#117)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/117).
- Added support for Python 3.9, extending the set of supported python versions to
  3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9
  [(#160)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/160).
- [llvm] Added a new `InstCount` observation space that contains the counts of
  each type of instruction
  [(#159)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/pull/159).

**Build dependencies update notice:** If you are building from source and
upgrading from an older version of CompilerGym, your build environment will need
to be updated. The easiest way to do that is to remove your existing conda
environment using `conda remove --name compiler_gym --all` and to repeat the
steps in [building from
source](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CompilerGym#building-from-source).

## Release 0.1.6 (2021-03-22)

This release focuses on hardening the LLVM environments, providing improved
semantics validation, and improving the datasets. Many thanks to @JD-at-work,
@bwasti, and @mostafaelhoushi for code contributions.

- [llvm] Added a new `cBench-v1` dataset which changes the function attributes
  of the IR to permit inlining. `cBench-v0` is deprecated and will be removed no
  earlier than v0.1.6.
- [llvm] Removed 15 passes from the LLVM action space: `-bounds-checking`,
  `-chr`, `-extract-blocks`, `-gvn-sink`, `-loop-extract-single`,
  `-loop-extract`, `-objc-arc-apelim`, `-objc-arc-contract`, `-objc-arc-expand`,
  `-objc-arc`, `-place-safepoints`, `-rewrite-symbols`,
  `-strip-dead-debug-info`, `-strip-nonlinetable-debuginfo`, `-structurizecfg`.
  Passes are removed if they are: irrelevant (e.g. used only debugging), if they
  change the program semantics (e.g. inserting runtimes bound checking), or if
  they have been found to have nondeterministic behavior between runs.
- Extended `env.step()` so that it can take a list of actions that are all
  performed in a single batch. This improve efficiency.
- Added default reward spaces for `CompilerEnv` that are derived from scalar
  observations (thanks @bwasti!)
- Added a new Q learning example (thanks @JD-at-work!).
- *Deprecation:* The v0.1.9 release will introduce a new datasets API that is
  easier to use and more flexible. In preparation for this, the `Dataset` class
  has been renamed to `LegacyDataset`, the following dataset operations have
  been marked deprecated: `activate()`, `deactivate()`, and `delete()`. The
  `GetBenchmarks()` RPC interface method has also been marked deprecated..
- [llvm] Improved semantics validation using LLVM's memory, thread, address, and
  undefined behavior sanitizers.
- Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

## Release 0.1.3 (2021-02-25)

This release adds numerous enhancements aimed at improving ease-of-use. Thanks
to @broune, @hughleat, and @JD-ETH for contributions.

* Added a new `env.validate()` API for validating the state of an environment.
  Added semantics validation for some LLVM benchmarks.
* Added a `env.fork()` method to efficiently duplicate an environment state.
* The `manual_env` environment has been improved with new features such as hill
  climbing search and tab completion.
* Ease of use improvements for string observation space and reward space names:
  Added new getter methods such as `env.observation.Autophase()` and generated
  constants such as `llvm.observation_spaces.autophase`.
* *Breaking change*: Calculation of environment reward has been moved to Python.
  Reward functions have been removed from backend service implementations and
  replaced with equivalent Python classes.
* Various bug fixes and improvements.

## Release 0.1.2 (2021-01-25)

* Add a new `compiler_gym.views.ObservationView.add_derived_space(...)` API
  for constructing derived observation spaces.
* Added default reward and observation values for `env.step()` in case of
  service failure.
* Extended the public `compiler_gym.datasets` API for managing datasets.
* [llvm] Adds `-Norm`-suffixed rewards that are normalized to unoptimized cost.
* Extended documentation and example codes.
* Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

## Release 0.1.1 (2020-12-28)

* Expose the package version through `compiler_gym.__version__`, and
  the compiler version through `CompilerEnv.compiler_version`.
* Add a [notebook
  version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/CompilerGym/blob/development/examples/getting-started.ipynb)
  of the "Getting Started" guide that can be run in colab.
* [llvm] Reformulate reward signals to be cumulative.
* [llvm] Add a new reward signal based on the size of the `.text`
  section of compiled object files.
* [llvm] Add a `LlvmEnv.make_benchmark()` API for easily constructing
  custom benchmarks for use in environments.
* Numerous bug fixes and improvements.

## Release 0.1.0 (2020-12-21)
